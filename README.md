# MultiScan
A python implementation for multi-threaded TCP based scanning for ports

I needed a multi-threaded scanner in python that is usable when other options fail. Most often times linux hosts and some windows hosts have python installed. Rather than forcing the installation of tools onto a system this method of LOLBIN utilizes python, more specifically python3 if they have it, to do fast TCP port scanning fast and efficiently.
